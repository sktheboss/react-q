- Request Lifecycle
-  Atomic design
-  Design systems
-  Render Tree
-  Reflow/layout
-  Async & defer. 
-  Semantic HTML & how it helps in web accessibility, DOM.
-  Forms & validations- create the HTML form with Proper Semantic Tags, should Know native HTML validations and JS way of validation as well.
-  *Media* - Responsive Images, Audio and Video

# Object oriented JavaScript

- **Fundamentals** - Variables, Scope, Data Types, operators, loops, if statements, error handling  and functions. 
- Execution Context (this). [Call, Apply, Bind
- Differentiating factors in ES5 and ES6
- Lexical scope
- How to destructure simple object

- Events and Event Handling
- DOM manupilation
- Object handling
- Stop propagation.
- Object Prototype, Prototypal Inheritance
- Closure
- Async Programming - Event Loop and how it works
- Macro and Micro tasks,
- Callbacks and setTimeOut
- **Promises** - chaining promises, [Promise.all, Promise.race ], error handling, async / await.
- **Testing** -  POV on different type of tests, Different libraries (TL, Jest, Enzyme, Karma, Jasmine)
-  **Patterns** - Module Systems & Principles, Singleton, Factory functions, Module, Prototype, PubSub, Observable
- Common JS
- UMD
- AMD
- 12-factor app
- SOLID
- DRY principles

# Functional Programming

- Pure Functions / Side Effects / Purifying closures
- Point-free style
- Composition / Compound functions
- Immutability
- Map / Reduce / Filter
- Higher-order functions
- Currying / Composing
- To write solution using Proper Inbuilt Efficient HOF for an array operation
- **PWA (progressive web app)** - App Manifest, Caching & Service Workers, Background Sync, Push Notifications, Workbox.

# Tooling:
 - **Webpack / Parcel / Rollup** - config from-ground setup, 
 - Code Splitting
 - Tree Shaking
 - Fedration
 - Loaders and plugins
 - Transpilation using tools like Babel
 - Understands GIT hooks and can use them. 
 - Code bundling/minification/production ready assets using Webpack
 - ESLint, Husky and other static code analysis tools  

# NFR (Non Functional Requirements)

# Performance:
- Compression
- Caching / CDN / Expirations
- HTTP Headers
- JS Profiling (CPU/MEM)
- HTTP2
- Universal View State
- Perf Analysis / Log monitoring tools
- Basic perf testing: lighthouse, webpagetests. 
- Awareness of metrices like TTFB, TTI and their possible high no. causes

# Security:
- SSL/TLS
- CORS
- XSS
- CSRF
- Access / Refresh Tokens / Encryptions
- Validations / Encoding
- HTTP Cookies / Sec. Headers, Sessions / Authentication / Authorization / protect user data
- RBAC
- ABAC

# Accessibility:
 - Understands A/ AA / AAA accessibility guidelines and write code adhering to meet the accessibility benchmarks,
 - Has a fair understanding to make dynamic content accessible with ARIA
 - Uses enhanced techniques to meet accessibility standards viz: skip navigation, no js etc
 - Creating accesible forms, content and best practices

# DevOps:
 - Gulp/Grunt - create tasks / custom scripts
 - Webpack / Parcel / Rollup - config from-ground setup
 - Code Splitting
 - Loaders and plugins
 - Understands GIT hooks and can use them. - Code bundling/minification/production ready assets using Webpack etc
 - Test Case runners
 - Docker
 - Vagrant and the differences.
 - integrate plugins like sitespeed.io to ensure performance related checks on the pages
# Logging Standards:
 - Can customize logging framework to extend to create own formats with additional data like session id, hostname for log statements.
